# Basic Calculator Framework:
# This calculator will allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction,
# multiplication, and division. It will take two numbers as input and an operator to specify the desired
# operation. The calculator will handle user input and display the result. Additionally, weâ€™ll include
# basic error handling to manage issues like division by zero and invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth
# user experience. This framework can be expanded with more operations or a GUI in future versions.
